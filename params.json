{"name":"ruby-serial","tagline":"Optimized serialization library for Ruby objects.","body":"### ruby-serial\r\n\r\nruby-serial is a Ruby library serializing Ruby objects, optimized in many ways:\r\n\r\n* **Space efficient**: Use MessagePack (binary compact storage) and don't serialize twice the same object\r\n* **Keep shared objects**: if an object is shared by others, serialization still keeps the reference and does not duplicate objects in memory\r\n* Gives the ability to **fine tune which attributes of your objects are to be serialized**\r\n* Keeps **backward compatibility** with previously serialized versions.\r\n* Has **callbacks support** to fine tune the serialization process.\r\n* Can serialize objects having **reference cycles** (self-contained Arrays, Hashes, objects...)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nRubySerial is packaged as a simple Ruby gem:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install ruby-serial\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nIts usage is the same as Marshal library:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'ruby-serial' \r\n# Create example\r\nclass User\r\n  attr_accessor :name\r\n  attr_accessor :comment\r\n  def ==(other)\r\n    other.is_a?(User) and (@name == other.name) and (@comment == other.comment)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nshared_obj = 'This string instance will be shared'\r\nuser = User.new\r\nuser.name = 'John'\r\nuser.comment = shared_obj # shared_obj is referenced here\r\nobj = [\r\n  'My String',\r\n  shared_obj, # shared_obj is also referenced here\r\n  1,\r\n  user\r\n]\r\n \r\n# Get obj as a serialized String\r\nserialized_obj = RubySerial::dump(obj) \r\n# Get back our objects from the serialized String\r\ndeserialized_obj = RubySerial::load(serialized_obj) \r\n# Both objects are the same\r\nputs \"Same? #{obj == deserialized_obj}\"\r\n# => true\r\n \r\n# The shared object is still shared!\r\nputs \"Shared? #{deserialized_obj[1].object_id == deserialized_obj[3].comment.object_id}\"\r\n# => true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### More info\r\n\r\n[Complete doc over here](http://ruby-serial.sourceforge.net)!\r\n\r\n[Bug tracker](http://sourceforge.net/p/ruby-serial/bugs/)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nContributions, questions, jokes?
